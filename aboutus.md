title: About Us
---
Science Squad engages younger students to expose them to and excite them about STEM. We teach them to use the scientific method to problem-solve, communicate information, and function as one scientific community. We encourage scientific thinking in various STEM domains, including chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering. By introducing students to a variety of material, showing enthusiasm, and helping them to critically engage with the subject, we hope to inspire the next generation of STEM leaders as they start thinking about their futures in college and beyond.

## What we do
Throughout the year, we volunteer at regional science fairs, teach science classes at NEPTUN, and participate in science programs around Boston, so as to promote high school studentsâ€™ interest in STEM education through hands-on experiences in the greater Boston area.

## Upcoming Events
We are currently planning on participating in virtual science fairs across Boston. As of now we are interested in attending the BPS Science Fair. Later we also plan to work on designing our Spring Classes for a virtual rendeition of NEPTUNE.
